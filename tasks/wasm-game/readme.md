## Happy PASECA
Twin sons of my mothers uncle semi-dad who live in the near village are trying to do some gamedev. One of them, legendary Boka, is a code-writer. Second one - his popular brother Joka, is making some design solutions.
Their first game is gradually coming to the release state, so they gave us a pre-release firefox version to dome some testing. They are rewarding a, probably, some piece of cloth on a stick, if we correctly understood... Ehm, anyway, can you look into that?
